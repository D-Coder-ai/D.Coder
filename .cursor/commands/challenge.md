Lets take a pause here. Document the latest challenge that you are facing, your possible options, what you have tried and what is not working. INclude any relevant documentation references from docs/ that are associated with this problem. Output this document as a md file in docs/challenges and ensure to keep it concise (less-verbose) and to the point. After documenting stop and wait for further instructions.
