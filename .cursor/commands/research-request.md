Do you want to gather any knowledge about any decision that we have taken in this plan ? If yes, we should use the websearch tool and exa-search mcp to get answers from the web on how generally those decisions are made or the conventional choices. For any library specific assumptions, I would recommend that you invoke the context7 mcp and get the latest and proper information. If you are in plan mode, use the researched knowledge to refine your plan.
